  heading: Why Kaldi?
  text: Kaldi is the coffee store for everyone who believes that great coffee shouldn't
    just taste good, it should do good too. We source all of our beans directly from
    small scale sustainable farmers and make sure part of the profits are reinvested
    in their communities.

  heading: Our values
  text: Coffee is an amazing part of human culture but it has a dark side too – one
    of colonialism and mindless abuse of natural resources and human lives. We want
    to turn this around and return the coffee trade to the drink’s exhilarating, empowering
    and unifying nature.
